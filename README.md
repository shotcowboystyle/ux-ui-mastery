## Why This Exists

Most design tools give you components. Most AI assistants give you opinions. Neither gives you **the science of why users behave the way they do** — and the production code to act on it.

This plugin gives Claude Code the equivalent of a senior UX designer's entire career knowledge: cognitive psychology, battle-tested heuristics, platform-native component code, real product case studies, and the latest 2025-2026 research — all activated automatically when you need it.

**The result:** Claude doesn't just suggest "make the button bigger." It tells you Fitts's Law predicts a 23% improvement at 48px, generates the accessible React component with all 10 states, and flags that your 14-option dropdown violates Hick's Law.

## What Changed in v3.0

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Claude Code CLI](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) installed and authenticated
- No other dependencies — the plugin is pure markdown, zero config

---

### Method 1: Install from GitHub Marketplace (Recommended for End Users)

This is the standard way to install Claude Code plugins. Run these commands **inside a Claude Code session**:

```
/plugin marketplace add shotcowboystyle/ux-ui-mastery
/plugin install ux-ui-mastery@ux-ui-mastery-marketplace
```

That's it. The plugin is now permanently installed and available in every session.

To choose installation scope:

- **User scope** (all projects): Plugin is registered in `~/.claude/settings.json`
- **Project scope** (team-shared): Plugin is registered in `.claude/settings.json` in your project
- **Local scope** (personal, gitignored): Plugin is registered in `.claude/settings.local.json`

---

### Method 2: Clone + Load Directly (For Development / Testing)

Clone the repo anywhere, then load it with the `--plugin-dir` flag:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shotcowboystyle/ux-ui-mastery.git
claude --plugin-dir ./ux-ui-mastery
```

This loads the plugin for that session only. Great for testing or development.

---

### Method 3: Clone + Register Permanently (Manual)

**Step 1:** Clone into the plugins directory:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/plugins
cd ~/.claude/plugins
git clone https://github.com/shotcowboystyle/ux-ui-mastery.git
```

**Step 2:** Register the plugin in your Claude Code settings. Edit `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "enabledPlugins": {
    "ux-ui-mastery": true
  }
}
```

**Step 3:** Restart Claude Code. The plugin loads automatically every session.

---

### Verify Installation

Start Claude Code and run any slash command:

```
/ux-audit
/cognitive-check
/component-build
/design-critique
/figma-to-code
```

Commands appear as `/ux-ui-mastery:command-name` (e.g., `/ux-ui-mastery:ux-audit`).

You can also test skill activation by asking about any trigger topic:

```
"What does Fitts's Law say about button sizing?"
"Audit this component for cognitive load"
"Build me a React modal with all states"
"What went wrong with the Snapchat 2018 redesign?"
```

The relevant skill and deep references load automatically based on your query.

### Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Commands not showing up | Restart Claude Code after installation |
| `/plugin` command not recognized | Update Claude Code to the latest version |
| Skills not activating on topics | Verify `plugin.json` exists at `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` |
| Want to uninstall | Run `/plugin uninstall ux-ui-mastery` or remove from `settings.json` |

### Requirements

- Claude Code CLI (latest version)
- No external dependencies — pure markdown, zero config, works offline

## How It Works

The plugin uses **progressive disclosure** — the same cognitive principle it teaches. Only the relevant skill and its references load based on your query, keeping Claude's context lean while providing deep expertise on demand.

Ask about "cognitive load" and Claude loads the cognitive psychology skill with 25+ Laws of UX. Ask about "React button component" and Claude loads the component patterns skill with the full React cookbook. Ask about "iOS 26" and Claude loads mobile UX with the Liquid Glass deep-dive.

Every skill cross-references every other skill. Critique methodology connects to heuristic evaluation. Component code connects to accessibility. Figma workflows connect to design tokens. Cognitive biases connect to ethics. It's a web of knowledge, not a stack of silos.
