# Figma to Code Command

Transform a Figma design specification into production-ready code using the design-to-code flywheel. This command bridges the gap between design intent and engineering implementation.

## Pipeline Protocol

1. **Ingest the design specification**: Accept Figma design input in any available form.
   - Figma file URL or frame/component link
   - Figma MCP server data (if MCP connection available)
   - Pasted design spec (dimensions, colors, typography, spacing, assets)
   - Screenshot with design annotations
   - Exported Figma Dev Mode properties

2. **Extract design tokens**: Parse the design into structured tokens.
   - **Color**: Map fills, strokes, and effects to semantic color tokens
   - **Typography**: Extract font family, size, weight, line-height, letter-spacing into type scale tokens
   - **Spacing**: Identify padding, margin, and gap values; map to spacing scale
   - **Elevation**: Parse shadows into elevation tier tokens
   - **Border radius**: Extract corner radius values into shape tokens
   - **Layout**: Identify auto-layout direction, gap, padding, alignment
   - Output tokens in W3C Design Tokens format (JSON) and platform-specific formats

3. **Identify component structure**: Decompose the design into a component tree.
   - Map Figma layers to semantic HTML elements
   - Identify reusable components vs. one-off layouts
   - Detect component variants (size, state, type) from Figma component properties
   - Map Figma auto-layout to CSS Flexbox/Grid or SwiftUI stacks
   - Identify interactive states from Figma component sets

4. **Generate platform code**: Produce implementation for the target platform.

   **React/TypeScript (default)**:
   - Functional components with typed props
   - CSS Modules, Tailwind, or styled-components (match project convention)
   - Responsive layout using container queries where beneficial
   - Design token consumption via CSS custom properties

   **SwiftUI**:
   - Native SwiftUI views with proper stack composition
   - Dynamic Type support
   - iOS 26 Liquid Glass materials where the design uses translucency
   - Color assets for light/dark mode

   **HTML/CSS**:
   - Semantic HTML structure
   - Modern CSS with custom properties, logical properties, and grid/flexbox
   - Responsive breakpoints or container queries

5. **Validate accessibility**: Check generated code against WCAG requirements.
   - Semantic element selection (not div soup)
   - ARIA attributes for non-standard patterns
   - Color contrast verification against extracted tokens
   - Focus order matching visual layout
   - Touch target sizing (44x44pt minimum)

6. **Generate handoff documentation**: Produce specification notes.
   - Token mapping table (Figma layer -> token name -> CSS property)
   - Responsive behavior notes
   - Interaction specifications (hover, focus, active states)
   - Animation specifications if applicable
   - Known deviations from design with rationale

## Output Format

```
## Figma to Code: [Component/Screen Name]

### Design Token Extraction
[W3C format JSON tokens extracted from the design]

### Component Tree
[Hierarchical breakdown of components identified]

### Generated Code

#### React/TypeScript
[Complete component code with tokens]

#### CSS
[Stylesheet with custom properties]

### Accessibility Validation
- [ ] Semantic HTML elements used
- [ ] ARIA attributes applied where needed
- [ ] Color contrast passes AA (4.5:1 text, 3:1 UI)
- [ ] Focus indicators visible
- [ ] Touch targets >= 44x44pt

### Handoff Notes
[Token mapping, responsive behavior, interaction specs, deviations]

### Design-Code Fidelity Checklist
- [ ] Colors match design tokens (within 1% tolerance)
- [ ] Typography matches type scale
- [ ] Spacing matches spatial system
- [ ] Layout matches auto-layout spec
- [ ] Border radius matches shape tokens
- [ ] Elevation/shadow matches design
```
