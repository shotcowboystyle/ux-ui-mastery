# Accessibility Check Command

Perform a deep accessibility audit against WCAG 2.2 AA standards on the provided code or component.

## Audit Protocol

1. **Semantic HTML Analysis**:
   - Verify proper heading hierarchy (h1-h6)
   - Check landmark regions (nav, main, aside, header, footer)
   - Validate form labels, fieldsets, and legends
   - Verify list structure (ul/ol/li)
   - Check table accessibility (th, scope, caption)
   - Ensure buttons vs links are used correctly

2. **ARIA Implementation**:
   - Check for redundant ARIA (ARIA that duplicates native semantics)
   - Verify all ARIA roles have required attributes
   - Validate aria-label, aria-labelledby, aria-describedby references
   - Check live regions for dynamic content
   - Verify modal/dialog focus management

3. **Keyboard Navigation**:
   - Verify tab order follows visual layout
   - Check for keyboard traps
   - Verify focus indicators are visible and meet contrast requirements
   - Check composite widget keyboard patterns (tabs, menus, trees)
   - Verify skip navigation links

4. **Visual Accessibility**:
   - Calculate color contrast ratios for all text
   - Check for color-only information encoding
   - Verify text resizing up to 200% without loss
   - Check for respecting prefers-reduced-motion
   - Verify prefers-color-scheme support

5. **Content Accessibility**:
   - Check image alt text (present, meaningful, or empty for decorative)
   - Verify link text is descriptive out of context
   - Check for plain language and reading level
   - Verify error messages are associated with fields

## Accessibility Audit Results

### Compliance Level: [A / AA / AAA / Non-compliant]
### Issues Found: [X critical, X serious, X moderate, X minor]

### Critical Issues (Must Fix)
[Each with: WCAG criterion, code location, description, fix with code]

### Serious Issues (Should Fix)
[Same format]

### Moderate Issues (Good to Fix)
[Same format]

### Passing Checks
[What the code does well]

### Recommended Testing
- [ ] Screen reader testing with [VoiceOver/NVDA]
- [ ] Keyboard-only navigation test
- [ ] 200% zoom test
- [ ] Color blindness simulation
