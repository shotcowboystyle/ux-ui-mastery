# Design Review Command

Perform a comprehensive design review evaluating the provided UI across all 10 UX/UI skill domains.

## Review Protocol

1. **Identify the target**: Determine the component, screen, flow, or application to review.

2. **Score each domain** (1-10 scale):

| Domain | What to Evaluate |
|--------|-----------------|
| Heuristic Compliance | Nielsen's 10 heuristics adherence |
| Research Foundation | Evidence of user-centered design decisions |
| Mobile Experience | Touch targets, responsive behavior, mobile patterns |
| Desktop Experience | Information density, keyboard support, workflow efficiency |
| Visual Design | Typography, color, spacing, hierarchy, consistency |
| Accessibility | WCAG compliance, keyboard nav, screen reader support |
| Interaction Design | Micro-interactions, transitions, feedback, loading states |
| Future-Readiness | AI integration, spatial awareness, multimodal support |
| System Architecture | Design tokens, component reusability, theming |
| Ethics & Content | Dark pattern avoidance, content quality, inclusive language |

3. **For each domain, provide**:
   - Score (1-10) with brief justification
   - Top strength in this domain
   - Top improvement opportunity
   - Specific recommendation with implementation guidance

4. **Generate overall assessment**:
   - Weighted overall score
   - Radar chart data (for visualization)
   - Priority improvement roadmap (Quick wins -> Medium effort -> Strategic)
